# Weekly Taiwan Strait Security Report
## Week 51, 2025 | December 15 - December 21, 2025

**Threat Level: Elevated**

## Executive Summary

During the week of December 15-21, 2025, there was a notable increase in activity within the Taiwan Strait, with a total of 40 events recorded, up from 31 events the previous week. This rise is attributed primarily to a surge in political movements and air operations, as the People's Liberation Army (PLA) continues to maintain a significant presence in the region. Despite the total number of events rising, the overall threat level remains elevated due to the critical nature of several incidents, including multiple PLA sorties crossing the Taiwan Strait median line and significant naval deployments. The Taiwan Strait remains a focal point of geopolitical tension, with persistent military posturing and diplomatic maneuvering by regional and extra-regional actors. The threat assessment for the region is elevated, given the sustained military activities and political developments that could potentially escalate into broader confrontations.


## Air Operations

This week, there were 12 air-related events involving PLA aircraft operations around Taiwan. Notably, multiple sorties breached the Taiwan Strait median line, signaling an assertive posture by the PLA. No ADIZ incursions were reported, but the presence of new assets, such as the CH-7 stealth endurance drone, suggests advancements in China's aerial capabilities. The operational pattern indicates a strategic emphasis on maintaining pressure on Taiwan's air defenses, with flights often involving mixed formations of fighter jets and surveillance aircraft.

## Naval Activity

Naval operations saw increased activity with three notable events, including the transit of the PLA aircraft carrier Fujian through the Taiwan Strait. This maneuver underscores China's intent to project naval power within the region. Additionally, the Taiwan Coast Guard expelled four Chinese Coast Guard ships from the vicinity of Kinmen, illustrating ongoing maritime disputes. These movements highlight the strategic importance of the Taiwan Strait as a maritime chokepoint and China's commitment to assert its influence.

## Political Developments

Politically, the week was dominated by Taiwan's diplomatic engagements and China-related tensions. Taiwan's acknowledgment of U.S. military support, including the provision of ALTIUS loitering munitions, reflects deepening defense ties. Meanwhile, Japan's reaffirmation of a peaceful resolution stance aims to ease tensions with Beijing, although China's travel restrictions to Japan indicate underlying diplomatic frictions. The Taiwan National Security Bureau's report on U.S. deterrence efforts in the First Island Chain further emphasizes the geopolitical stakes in the region.

## Military Posture

Taiwan's military posture is bolstered by the arrival and testing of the second batch of M1A2T tanks, enhancing its armored capabilities. The PLA's continued exercises and cross-median line sorties demonstrate China's readiness to challenge Taiwan's defense perimeter. No significant changes in readiness levels were observed, but the ongoing developments necessitate close monitoring of both sides' military postures.

## Trend Analysis

The increase in events this week indicates a heightened level of activity, particularly in air and political domains. Comparatively, the number of critical incidents rose, underscoring an elevated threat environment. The persistent crossing of the median line by PLA sorties marks a pattern of increased assertiveness, while diplomatic engagements suggest a complex interplay between regional powers. The lack of de-escalation indicators points to a sustained period of tension.

## Forward Outlook

Looking forward, the Taiwan Strait is expected to remain a hotspot of military and political activity. Key events to watch include potential follow-up actions to the PLA carrier transit and any further diplomatic movements related to U.S.-Taiwan defense cooperation. The risk of miscalculation remains significant, necessitating vigilant monitoring of military activities and diplomatic statements.



## Key Events This Week

- PLA aircraft and naval vessels operate around Taiwan; multiple sorties cross median line
- PLA aircraft carrier Fujian transits Taiwan Strait
- Taiwan and Poland to co-develop military drones
- Taiwan NSB report on US bolstering deterrence in First Island Chain


## Outlook

The Taiwan Strait will continue to experience elevated military and political activity, with potential for further escalations as regional powers assert their strategic interests.
