## Executive Summary

During the week of December 15-21, 2025, the Taiwan Strait witnessed a notable increase in military and political activities, with a total of 40 events reported. This reflects a 29% rise in incidents compared to the previous week, indicating heightened tensions in the region. Critical developments included the testing of the second batch of M1A2T tanks in Taiwan and multiple PLA sorties crossing the median line. The United States' bolstering of its deterrence in the First Island Chain was highlighted in a report by Taiwan's National Security Bureau, underscoring the strategic importance of the region amidst growing Chinese assertiveness. The overall threat level remains elevated, with significant military maneuvers and political posturing observed from both regional and international actors.

The week was marked by a variety of activities, with political developments taking precedence, accounting for 13 events. Air operations, particularly by the PLA, were prominent, with 12 recorded incidents, including sorties crossing the median line, a key indicator of aggressive posturing. Naval activities included the transit of the PLA aircraft carrier Fujian through the Taiwan Strait, further exemplifying China's persistent military presence. The diplomatic landscape saw Japan reiterating its commitment to a peaceful resolution over Taiwan, amidst increased US military support to Taiwan, which Beijing views as a provocation. As tensions persist, vigilance remains critical, with the current threat level assessed as Elevated.

The week-over-week trend shows a significant increase in the number of events, particularly in the air and political domains. The rise in critical events, from zero last week to four this week, highlights the potential for escalation. The absence of air incursions this week suggests a strategic shift, possibly indicating restraint or recalibration in Chinese tactics. However, the sustained presence of PLA forces in the vicinity of Taiwan underscores the persistent threat environment.


## Air Operations

This week, PLA air operations around Taiwan were characterized by a series of sorties and exercises, totaling 12 events. Notably, multiple sorties crossed the median line, marking a significant breach of the unofficial boundary and signaling increased assertiveness. The deployment of various aircraft types, including the maiden flight of the new CH-7 stealth endurance drone, suggests a focus on testing advanced capabilities and demonstrating strategic reach. The absence of direct incursions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ) indicates a potential tactical restraint or shift in operational focus.

## Naval Activity

Naval activities in the Taiwan Strait featured the transit of the PLA aircraft carrier Fujian, marking a significant projection of naval power in the region. Additionally, Taiwan's coast guard expelled four Chinese coast guard ships from Kinmen, highlighting ongoing maritime tensions. These movements, alongside the detection of PLA naval vessels operating around Taiwan, underscore the strategic maritime posture China maintains in the strait, aimed at asserting control and deterring foreign influence.

## Political Developments

Significant political developments included Japan's reaffirmation of its stance on a peaceful resolution regarding Taiwan, likely aimed at reducing tensions with Beijing. Concurrently, Taiwan's acknowledgment of receiving ALTIUS loitering munitions and other defense equipment from the US demonstrates deepening military cooperation, which Beijing perceives as a threat. Taiwan's NSB emphasized the US's bolstered deterrence in the First Island Chain, highlighting strategic alignment against Chinese expansionism.

## Military Posture

Taiwan's military posture was bolstered by the testing of the M1A2T tanks, reflecting an ongoing modernization effort to enhance defense capabilities. The PLA's persistent presence, alongside these developments, indicates a sustained readiness and potential for conflict escalation. However, the absence of air incursions suggests a tactical adjustment or momentary de-escalation.

## Trend Analysis

This week's activities showed a marked increase in both political and military events, indicating a heightened state of regional tensions. The pattern of median line crossings and strategic military developments point to a concerted effort by China to assert its influence, while the US and its allies continue to reinforce deterrence measures. Compared to previous weeks, the rise in critical incidents and political statements suggests an elevated risk of miscalculation.

## Forward Outlook

The coming week is likely to see continued military and political maneuvering, with potential for increased diplomatic engagements. Key dates include upcoming regional summits and military exercises, which may serve as platforms for further strategic posturing. Risk indicators remain elevated, with a focus on monitoring PLA activities and international responses.
