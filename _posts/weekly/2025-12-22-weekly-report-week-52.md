## Executive Summary

This week witnessed a marginal decrease in events around the Taiwan Strait, with a total of 39 incidents compared to 40 from the previous week. The most significant development was a critical event involving Chinese aircraft crossing the Taiwan Strait median line into Taiwan's ADIZ. This activity underscores the persistent tensions in the region. Politically, diplomatic friction between Beijing and Tokyo over Japanese lawmakers' visits to Taiwan suggests increasing complexity in regional alliances. Militarily, the PLA's escalated presence around Taiwan, alongside Taiwan's own military readiness activities, suggests a continued high alert status. The overall threat level remains elevated due to these persistent military and political pressures.


## Air Operations

The week saw 13 air-related events, with PLA aircraft frequently operating around Taiwan and crossing the median line into the ADIZ on several occasions. Notably, there were no air incursions recorded this week, though the presence of PLA aircraft in proximity to Taiwan's airspace remains a constant. The aircraft formations primarily involved fighter jets and reconnaissance planes, reflecting a pattern of intimidation and intelligence gathering.

## Naval Activity

Naval operations included the detection of PLA vessels operating around Taiwan, in conjunction with air sorties. The presence of these vessels suggests coordinated military maneuvers designed to project power and maintain pressure on Taiwan. No significant changes in ship deployments were noted, but the persistent naval activity remains a critical concern for Taiwan's defense posture.

## Political Developments

Beijing's protest against Japanese lawmakers' visits to Taiwan marks a significant diplomatic incident, indicating strained China-Japan relations. Furthermore, discussions on whether Taiwan's KMT can advance Beijing's reunification agenda reflect ongoing geopolitical maneuvering. Taiwan's outreach to Honduras underscores Taipei's efforts to strengthen its international ties amidst Beijing's diplomatic pressures.

## Military Posture

Taiwan's military conducted a combat readiness drill in Hsinchu, involving Abrams tanks, demonstrating a robust defensive posture. These exercises are part of Taiwan's strategic response to increased PLA activities in the region, highlighting a heightened state of readiness.

## Trend Analysis

While there was a slight decrease in the total number of events, the intensity of activity, particularly air operations crossing the median line, suggests a persistent escalation. Diplomatic incidents and military readiness drills indicate that both sides are preparing for potential escalations. The lack of air incursions this week could imply a strategic pause or recalibration by the PLA.

## Forward Outlook

The coming week is likely to see continued military activity around Taiwan, with potential for further diplomatic tensions. Key dates include potential PLA exercises and international diplomatic engagements. Monitoring regional military deployments and political statements will be crucial for assessing future risks.



## Key Events This Week

- PLA aircraft cross median line into ADIZ
- Beijing protests Japanese lawmakers' visits to Taiwan
- Taiwan conducts Abrams tank combat readiness drill


## Outlook

The situation in the Taiwan Strait remains tense with a high threat level due to continued military activities and diplomatic challenges. Vigilance over PLA maneuvers and international reactions will be essential in the coming week.
