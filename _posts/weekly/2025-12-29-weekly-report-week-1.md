## Executive Summary

During the week of December 29, 2025, to January 4, 2026, the Taiwan Strait witnessed a significant escalation in military activities, marked by a total of 56 events. This represents an increase from the previous week's 41 events, indicating a heightened level of tension. Notably, 13 critical events were recorded, highlighting the severity of the situation. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted large-scale air and naval operations, while Taiwan responded with rapid readiness exercises. This period saw no air incursions, yet the presence of 130 PLA aircraft and 14 PLAN vessels near Taiwan underscores the increased military pressure. Political rhetoric intensified, with Taiwan condemning China's actions and Beijing reacting to external criticisms. Overall, the threat level in the Taiwan Strait remains high, with indicators pointing towards a potential escalation.


## Air Operations

This week, there were no recorded Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) incursions; however, the PLA deployed 130 aircraft in operations around Taiwan. The types of aircraft involved included fighter jets and reconnaissance planes, operating in large formations that suggest a focus on testing Taiwan's air defense capabilities. Notable activity near the median line was absent, possibly indicating a strategic decision to avoid further provocations.

## Naval Activity

PLA naval operations included the presence of 14 PLAN vessels around Taiwan, engaging in live-fire drills simulating a blockade. These exercises followed a major US arms sale to Taiwan, signaling China's discontent and strategic messaging. The deployment of such a significant naval force suggests a readiness to project power and influence in the region.

## Political Developments

Taiwan's government strongly condemned China's military actions, with the Defense Minister pledging a calm yet resolute response. Diplomatic tensions were further fueled by Beijing's condemnation of remarks by the Japanese Prime Minister regarding Taiwan. These incidents reflect the complex geopolitical dynamics and the potential for diplomatic fallout.

## Military Posture

Taiwan conducted rapid response exercises to enhance its military readiness amid PLA provocations. These exercises are part of routine defense measures but were notably intensified this week. The ROC armed forces remain on heightened alert, with a focus on countering potential saturation tactics by the PLA.

## Trend Analysis

The increase in events from 41 to 56 this week indicates a rising trend in military activities and tensions. The absence of ADIZ incursions may suggest tactical adjustments by the PLA. The continued presence of large PLA formations near Taiwan highlights a persistent threat, with potential for further escalation.

## Forward Outlook

The coming week is likely to see continued military posturing by the PLA, especially in response to any further international diplomatic developments. Key dates to monitor include upcoming regional security forums and potential PLA anniversaries. Indicators suggest a maintained high threat level, with risks of miscalculation remaining significant.



## Key Events This Week

- PLA conducts large-scale military exercises around Taiwan
- Taiwan conducts rapid response exercises amid PLA provocations
- Beijing condemns Japanese PM's remarks on Taiwan


## Outlook

Expect continued PLA military activities with heightened alertness from Taiwan's defense forces. Diplomatic engagements and international reactions will be critical in shaping the security environment.
