## Executive Summary

During the week of January 05 to January 11, 2026, the Taiwan Strait experienced a total of 20 security-related events, a significant decrease from the previous week's 56 events. Key developments included multiple air operations by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) around Taiwan, along with notable political and naval activities. Despite the drop in total incidents, the presence of three critical events indicates persistent tensions in the region. Overall, the threat level remains elevated due to ongoing military maneuvers and diplomatic friction.

The week saw a marked reduction in air incursions, with no reported penetrations into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). This could suggest a temporary de-escalation or a strategic pause by the PLA. Politically, Taiwan firmly rejected Beijing's sanctions on its officials, while Japan's economic stance on Taiwan drew Chinese ire. The PLA's naval exercises continued, focusing on advanced tactics such as countering drone swarms, underscoring the ongoing strategic pressure on Taiwan.


## Air Operations

The week recorded 12 air-related events, characterized by PLA aircraft and naval vessels operating around Taiwan. Notably, there were no air incursions into the ADIZ, contrasting with previous weeks' activities. The PLA utilized a mix of aircraft types in formations that crossed the median line into Taiwan's southwestern ADIZ, suggesting a continued effort to assert presence and test Taiwan's air defenses.

## Naval Activity

PLA naval activities included exercises perceived as blockade rehearsals and training against drone swarms near Taiwan. These maneuvers highlight China's focus on developing capabilities to enforce a potential blockade and counter advanced threats. Ship movements were consistent with previous patterns, maintaining a pressure posture.

## Political Developments

Taiwan's rejection of Chinese sanctions on its officials was a significant diplomatic move, reinforcing its sovereignty stance. Japan's contemplation of economic leverage amid Beijing's backlash over Taiwan remarks adds an international dimension to the regional dynamics. These incidents reflect heightened diplomatic tensions and potential flashpoints.

## Military Posture

There were no significant changes in PLA force deployments or readiness levels this week. However, exercise activities continued, emphasizing the PLA's preparedness and capability development. The focus on counter-drone tactics indicates a strategic adaptation to emerging threats.

## Trend Analysis

The 64% reduction in events from last week suggests a temporary de-escalation or strategic recalibration by the PLA. However, the presence of critical incidents indicates that underlying tensions remain unresolved. The trend of combined air and naval operations persists, demonstrating a coordinated approach by the PLA.

## Forward Outlook

The coming week may see a continuation of the current reduced activity pattern, but vigilance is required due to the volatile nature of the region. Key events to monitor include any shifts in PLA naval deployments or new political developments. Risk indicators remain high due to the strategic importance of the Taiwan Strait.



## Key Events This Week

- Taiwan NSB Reports Rise in Chinese Cyberattacks
- PLA Naval Drills Practice Countering Swarms of Suicide Drones Near Taiwan
- Taiwan Rejects Beijing’s Sanctions on Two Ministers and Prosecutor


## Outlook

The security situation in the Taiwan Strait remains tense but stable, with potential for increased activity depending on political or military developments. Monitoring of PLA maneuvers and international diplomatic responses is crucial.
