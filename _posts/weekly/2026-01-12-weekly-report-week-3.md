## Executive Summary

The week of January 12 to January 18, 2026, saw a significant increase in activity in the Taiwan Strait, with a total of 44 events, doubling the previous week's count. Critical events numbered 12, indicating a heightened level of tension. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted numerous air and naval operations around Taiwan, with notable incursions into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), though no air incursions were reported this week. Politically, Taiwan moved to strengthen its Anti-Infiltration Law, highlighting growing concerns over Beijing-linked activities. The threat level in the region is assessed as elevated, with increased military posture by both the PLA and Taiwan's defense forces.


## Air Operations

PLA aircraft activity around Taiwan was significant this week, with 21 related events reported. Although there were no air incursions recorded, several aircraft, including advanced fighters, operated near the median line. The Taiwan Air Force resumed F-16 flight training after special inspections, indicating readiness to respond to potential threats.

## Naval Activity

PLA Navy operations included five vessels and multiple balloon deployments around Taiwan, signaling an increase in maritime presence. Joint air-sea exercises were conducted, enhancing the PLA's operational capabilities in the region. The deployment of a Trump-class battleship by the US prompted criticism from China, which deemed it vulnerable.

## Political Developments

Taiwan's legislative moves to toughen the Anti-Infiltration Law underscore escalating concerns over Chinese influence. The US and Taiwan's plan to co-produce 155mm artillery shells signifies deepening military cooperation. Official statements from Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) emphasized the urgency of revising the Anti-Infiltration Act, while Taiwan's President expressed gratitude to Canada for its support.

## Military Posture

Force readiness and posture remained high, with increased exercise activity by the PLA. Taiwan's military maintained elevated alert levels and resumed critical training exercises to ensure rapid response capabilities. The co-production of artillery shells with the US marks a significant enhancement in Taiwan's defense manufacturing capacity.

## Trend Analysis

The doubling of events from the previous week points to a trend of escalating tensions. The PLA's increased operational tempo, combined with Taiwan's legislative actions and international diplomatic engagements, suggests a complex interplay of military and political factors. The absence of air incursions may indicate a strategic pause, while naval operations continue to intensify.

## Forward Outlook

The coming week is expected to see continued PLA activity, potentially including new air incursions or naval exercises. Key dates include potential legislative sessions in Taiwan addressing the Anti-Infiltration Law. Risk indicators remain high, with the possibility of further diplomatic or military developments impacting regional stability.



## Key Events This Week

- PLA Navy conducts air-sea joint training near Taiwan
- Taiwan Moves to Toughen Anti-Infiltration Law
- Taiwan and US Plan Coproduction of 155mm Artillery Shells


## Outlook

Continued PLA military activity and political maneuvers are expected, with potential for heightened tensions impacting the region.
