## Executive Summary

This week in the Taiwan Strait, a total of 35 events were recorded, indicating a slight decline from the previous week's 44 events. This reduction is largely attributed to fewer routine and news events, while critical incidents remained constant at two. The political landscape was notably active, with significant diplomatic engagements and internal Taiwanese developments impacting the regional stability. Despite the political fervor, military activities, particularly air and naval operations, displayed a stable pattern with no air incursions reported. The threat level remains elevated due to continued PLA activities and political tensions, necessitating vigilant monitoring.


## Air Operations

This week saw no air incursions into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), a notable change from previous weeks. However, there were multiple instances of PLA aircraft crossing the median line, indicative of ongoing pressure tactics. Aircraft involved included multiple formations, primarily consisting of fighter jets such as J-10s and J-16s. This persistent median line activity suggests a sustained strategy of exerting military pressure without escalating to direct confrontations.

## Naval Activity

Naval operations were marked by the deployment of a PLA Type 075 amphibious assault ship and joint air-sea training exercises. These maneuvers were closely monitored by the Republic of China (ROC) Armed Forces, underscoring the importance of maintaining readiness. The presence of advanced amphibious capabilities in the vicinity of Taiwan serves as a strategic signal of China's amphibious operational readiness.

## Political Developments

The political arena was dominated by Taiwan's internal defense budget discussions and international diplomatic gestures. The closed-door briefing held by Taiwan's Defense Minister on a controversial special defense budget highlights the island's strategic focus on strengthening its military capabilities. Concurrently, the jailing of a Chinese spouse for United Front activities underscores Taiwan's vigilance against political subversion. On the international front, discussions between Taiwan and the US regarding high-tech supply chain cooperation indicate deepening ties amidst regional tensions.

## Military Posture

The overall military posture remained steady with no significant changes in force deployments or readiness levels. The ROC Armed Forces maintained high alertness, particularly in response to PLA naval exercises. This consistent posture reflects Taiwan's strategic approach to deterrence and defense in the face of potential PLA provocations.

## Trend Analysis

The reduction in overall events this week suggests a temporary stabilization in military activities, albeit within a context of heightened political tensions. The consistent pattern of median line crossings by PLA aircraft is a continuation of China's gray-zone tactics. Compared to previous weeks, there has been no significant escalation, but the persistent military presence poses a continuous pressure point.

## Forward Outlook

Looking ahead, the political climate is expected to remain tense, with potential implications for the military domain. Key dates to monitor include upcoming Taiwanese legislative sessions on defense appropriations and potential US-Taiwan diplomatic engagements. The risk indicators remain elevated, especially concerning political developments that could trigger military posturing.
