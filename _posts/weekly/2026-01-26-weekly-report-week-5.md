## Executive Summary

During the week of January 26 to February 01, 2026, the Taiwan Strait experienced a reduction in total events from the previous week, with 19 reported incidents compared to 35 last week. Despite the decrease in overall activity, the presence of two critical events underscores persistent regional tensions. Notably, air operations around Taiwan saw no incursions into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), although there were significant military demonstrations and political developments. The threat level remains elevated as China continues to employ a combination of air and naval maneuvers to project power and test Taiwan's defenses. Political discourse is increasingly focused on Taiwan's strategic partnerships and internal defense postures, as evidenced by high-level forums and statements from both Taiwan and allied nations. The current assessment suggests that while there is a temporary reduction in event volume, the strategic situation remains volatile, necessitating close monitoring of military and political developments.


## Air Operations

This week saw no direct incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ, marking a notable divergence from previous patterns of frequent airspace boundary crossings. However, large-scale operations were conducted by the People's Liberation Army (PLA), involving multiple aircraft formations and naval elements, which operated near the median line. The presence of PLA aircraft, naval vessels, and surveillance balloons around Taiwan indicates a continued focus on intelligence gathering and pressure application. These maneuvers serve to remind Taiwan of the PLA's operational readiness and capabilities.

## Naval Activity

China continued to leverage its maritime militia and naval forces to assert its presence in the region. Notable naval activities included the preparation of South China Sea reefs for potential operations against Taiwan and the deployment of 1,900 Chinese vessels near Taiwan's waters. Taiwan's response included demonstrations of littoral warfare capabilities and the initiation of sea trials for its indigenous submarine, 'Hai Kun'. The presence of PLA aircraft and naval vessels around Taiwan highlights the strategic importance of maintaining robust maritime defenses.

## Political Developments

Political tensions were evident as Japan's Minister issued warnings about the implications of ignoring the Taiwan crisis, stressing regional alliance commitments. Domestically, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) criticized the KMT-CCP Forum for undermining national dignity, while Taiwan and the US engaged in a high-level forum on artificial intelligence, indicating a deepening of strategic partnerships. Taiwan's Defense Ministry emphasized deterrence through social media campaigns, and President Lai's visit to Hualien underscored efforts to boost morale and defense readiness.

## Military Posture

Taiwan's military posture remains on heightened alert, as evidenced by increased readiness events during the Chinese New Year period. This aligns with ongoing demonstrations of rapid air force readiness and air defense capabilities. The PLA's continued cross-median line operations and large-scale exercises around Taiwan signal an ongoing commitment to military pressure strategies.

## Trend Analysis

The reduction in total events this week suggests a temporary de-escalation in activity, though the strategic environment remains tense. The absence of ADIZ incursions may indicate a tactical shift or temporary reprieve, but ongoing naval and air operations suggest that pressure on Taiwan will persist. Diplomatic activities and international forums highlight a growing focus on strategic alliances and regional security concerns.

## Forward Outlook

In the coming week, continued monitoring of PLA activities is essential, particularly any deviations from current patterns of engagement. Key dates to watch include upcoming political forums and potential maritime exercises. Risk indicators remain high, with the potential for rapid escalation should any new incursions or confrontations occur.



## Key Events This Week

- China Uses Maritime Militia to Prepare South China Sea Reef
- Taiwan Coast Guard Flags 1,900 Chinese Vessels
- Large-Scale PLA Air and Naval Operations
- Japanese Minister Warns Alliance at Risk


## Outlook

The strategic environment in the Taiwan Strait remains volatile with potential for escalation. Continued vigilance and diplomatic engagement are vital to managing regional tensions.
