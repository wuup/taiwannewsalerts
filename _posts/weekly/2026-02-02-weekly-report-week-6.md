## Executive Summary

During the week of February 02 to February 08, 2026, the Taiwan Strait saw a notable decrease in total events, from 19 last week to 11 this week, with one critical event reported. Key developments include political tensions marked by high-level diplomatic communications between China, the United States, and Russia, as well as Taiwan's strategic defense advancements. Air operations were characterized by continued PLA activity around Taiwan, although there were no reported airspace incursions. Naval activities included the deployment of China's Type 076 Amphibious Assault Ship, indicating sustained military readiness. Overall, the threat level remains elevated due to strategic military posturing and diplomatic strains.


## Air Operations

There were no air incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ this week, but PLA aircraft and vessels were active around Taiwan, crossing the median line into the ADIZ twice. The operations involved multiple sorties, suggesting persistent military pressure. The PLA also tested a hybrid transport drone, potentially enhancing their logistical capabilities in the Strait.

## Naval Activity

A significant naval development involved the Type 076 Amphibious Assault Ship, Sichuan, seen at sea with a possible GJ-21 stealth drone. This deployment underscores China's focus on enhancing amphibious and aerial capabilities, potentially increasing pressure on Taiwan's defenses.

## Political Developments

Diplomatic tensions were high as Taiwan's President Lai emphasized trade cooperation with democracies over China, while Chinese President Xi Jinping held rare back-to-back calls with Presidents Trump and Putin, cautioning against US arms sales to Taiwan. These exchanges underline the complex geopolitical landscape affecting cross-strait relations.

## Military Posture

Taiwan's President Lai's visit to a high-altitude radar station highlights Taiwan's continued investment in advanced surveillance capabilities. The PLA's activities indicate a sustained military posture aimed at maintaining pressure on Taiwan through strategic exercises and force readiness.

## Trend Analysis

Compared to previous weeks, the reduction in event frequency suggests a temporarily de-escalated environment, although the presence of strategic military assets maintains a high threat perception. The consistent pattern of PLA operations near Taiwan indicates an ongoing strategy of military intimidation.

## Forward Outlook

In the coming week, attention will focus on further diplomatic communications and any military exercises that might heighten tensions. Key dates include upcoming regional security conferences that may influence diplomatic discourse. Risk indicators remain high given the strategic military activities and political rhetoric.



## Key Events This Week

- Taiwan President Lai urges trade cooperation with democracies over China
- Xi Jinping cautions Trump on US arms sales to Taiwan
- PLA Aircraft and Vessels operate around Taiwan, cross median line


## Outlook

The Taiwan Strait remains a focal point of geopolitical tension, with elevated military readiness and diplomatic activity suggesting potential flashpoints. Continued monitoring of PLA movements and diplomatic engagements is essential.
